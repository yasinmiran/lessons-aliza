  - Understanding error messages (they're trying to help!)

### Hour 2: Variables and Data Types Deep Dive (60 minutes)
- **Variables as Containers** (20 min)
  - Memory addresses and variable names
  - Why we need different types (int, string, boolean, float)
  - Practice: Create variables for a simple student profile

- **How Data Flows in Programs** (20 min)
  - Input → Processing → Output pattern
  - Tracing through simple programs step by step
  - Practice: Follow the data through a temperature converter

- **Common Mistakes and Debugging** (20 min)
  - Type errors and how to fix them
  - Variable naming best practices
  - Practice: Fix intentionally broken code together

**Homework:** Write 3 simple programs that convert between different units (temperature, distance, time)

## Week 29: Control Structures & Program Flow (2 hours)

### Session Overview
**Goal:** Master the fundamental ways programs make decisions and repeat actions

### Hour 1: Making Decisions (60 minutes)
- **Boolean Logic in Real Life** (15 min)
  - True/False decisions we make daily
  - AND, OR, NOT operations with everyday examples
  - Practice: Create truth tables for simple scenarios

- **If Statements Deep Dive** (25 min)
  - Single conditions vs multiple conditions
  - When to use if/elif/else vs multiple if statements

  - Common pitfalls: assignment vs comparison (= vs ==)

- **Nested Decisions** (20 min)
  - Decision trees and flowcharts
  - When to nest vs when to use elif
  - Practice: Create a simple "choose your adventure" game

### Hour 2: Repetition and Loops (60 minutes)
- **Why We Need Loops** (15 min)
  - Avoiding repetitive code
  - Real-world examples of repetition
  - The concept of iteration

- **For Loops: When You Know How Many Times** (20 min)
  - Counting and iterating through collections
  - Range function and its uses
  - Practice: Print patterns, calculate sums
  - Common mistake: off-by-one errors

- **While Loops: When You Don't Know How Many Times** (15 min)
  - Condition-based repetition
  - Avoiding infinite loops
  - Practice: Number guessing game

- **Combining Concepts** (10 min)
  - Loops inside if statements
  - If statements inside loops
  - Practice: Simple menu system

**Homework:** Create a simple calculator that keeps asking for operations until user says "quit"

## Week 30: Functions & Putting It All Together (2 hours)

### Session Overview
**Goal:** Understand how to organize code and build a complete small program

### Hour 1: Functions - Breaking Down Problems (60 minutes)
- **Why Functions Exist** (15 min)
  - Avoiding code repetition
  - Making code easier to understand
  - Breaking big problems into smaller pieces
  - Real-world analogy: Recipe instructions

- **Creating and Using Functions** (25 min)
  - Parameters vs arguments (the difference matters!)
  - Return values vs printing
  - Practice: Convert previous homework into functions
  - Scope: Why variables inside functions stay inside

- **Function Design Principles** (20 min)
  - One function, one job
  - Good function names tell you what they do
  - Practice: Refactor messy code into clean functions

### Hour 2: Building a Complete Program (60 minutes)
- **Planning Before Coding** (15 min)
  - Breaking down the problem
  - Identifying what functions we need
  - Planning the main program flow

- **Project: Personal Expense Tracker** (40 min)
  - Add expenses with categories
  - View expenses by category
  - Calculate total spending
  - Simple text-based interface
  - Apply everything learned: variables, conditionals, loops, functions

- **Testing and Improving** (5 min)
  - Testing edge cases
  - Making the program user-friendly
  - Handling invalid input gracefully

**Final Project:** Enhance the expense tracker with one feature of choice (savings goals, monthly reports, or data persistence)
